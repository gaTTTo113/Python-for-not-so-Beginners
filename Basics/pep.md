# PEP

**PEP** stands for *Python Enhancement Proposal*, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.

**PEP 8**, sometimes spelled *PEP8* or *PEP-8*, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.

I think that it’s correct to mention such important document in this tutorial. Please make sure to read that before write some code. Investing 1-2 hours of your time in such thing can improve not only your Python code, but all your code in different languages in general.

You can find PEP-8 [***here***](

I’ll mention some of rules below:

- Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Do not mix spaces and tabs. Use tabs only with code already written with tabs.

- The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list, as in.

- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

- For long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.

- Imports should be grouped in the following order:
    1. Standard library imports.
    2. Related third party imports.
    3. Local application/library specific imports.
You should put a blank line between each group of imports.
