# Python for not-so-Beginners
***This tutorial was created for people, who already know principles of programming, using one or more programming languages and needed a quick start in Python.***

Internet contains tons of tutorials for complete beginners, they are great pieces of work, very useful in starting point of programmer journey, but as a person, who already became a developer, you can feel overwhelmed reading about what is variable or how to understand if construction for n-hundred time in your professional path. Some might say: but why not to repeat for yourself some concepts, OOP for example? Good question. In reality, practician programmer often has much more deeper understanding of concepts, that contains in complete beginner tutorials, so such repeating became redundant.

And what is alternative? Official documentation. We all know, that a good developer reads a lot of documentation, but also we know that a good developer works fast! What if you don’t really have much time to learn everything that contains in official docs, but a deadline is coming? And how to understand what is useful from it and what doesn’t in your particular case?

  

**In this tutorial** you will find *essential templates*, which can be used as ingredients in your program-soup :)

  

This templates are presenting to you just that minimal amount of information which truly required, but also for each topic I am giving you links, where you can learn more, if that wasn’t enough (other tutorials here on GitHub or/and on YouTube, links to official docs and sometimes even books.)

Tutorial is divided into two parts. Firs one called ***“Basics”*** contains all about Python “*Core*”.

Second called ***“Advanced”***  contains some specific topics, not unnecessary for reading them all, but some might be useful in your scenario.

  

### So here you can navigate through tutorial:
**Basics:**
  - [Installing Python.](Basics/Installing_python.md)
  - [Hello World, Variables, Math operators, Strings](Basics/HelloWorld.md)
  - [If statement](Basics/IF.md)
  - [Loops](Basics/loops.md)
  - [Lists](Basics/lists.md)
  - [Try statement](Basics/exept.md)
  - [Classes](Basics/classes.md)
  - [PEP](Basics/pep.md)
 
**Advanced:**
  - [Working with filesystem.](Advanced/pathlib.md)
  - [Excel automation](Advanced/excel.md)
  - [Easy JSON parsing](Advanced/json.md)

### Good luck!
